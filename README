This is just about the simplest example (HelloWorld style) application you can
build with FlickrApp.

FlickrApp itself has a variety of other helper methods but this is the short and
sweet example to get you started.

This application will do nothing more than check to see if you're signed in and
offer to log you in if you're not and log you out if you are. 

You will need:

* A copy of the FlickrApp package in your application's root directory; the one
  that contains main.py and friends. For example:

  ls -al example/
  total 48
  drwxr-xr-x  9 foo  bar   306 Aug  8 08:48 .
  drwxr-xr-x  8 foo  bar   272 Aug  8 08:30 ..
  lrwxr-xr-x  1 foo  bar    45 Aug  8 08:48 FlickrApp -> /usr/lib/python/gae-FlickrApp/FlickrApp
  drwxr-xr-x  3 foo  bar   102 Aug  8 08:45 HelloWorld
  -rw-r--r--  1 foo  bar  1377 Aug  8 08:48 README
  -rw-r-----@ 1 foo  bar   109 Aug  8 08:02 app.yaml
  -rw-r--r--  1 foo  bar   168 Aug  8 08:41 config.py
  -rw-r-----  1 foo  bar   471 Aug  8 08:26 index.yaml
  -rwxr-x---  1 foo  bar   463 Aug  8 08:41 main.py

* A valid Flickr API key, registered as a web application. Both the API key and
  the application secret will need to be added to the config.py file.

  If you don't have a Flickr API key, you can get one here:

  http://www.flickr.com/services/api/keys/apply/

* A valid GAE account and a recent version of the GAE SDK for Python (>= 1.2.3)
  which can be downloaded from:
